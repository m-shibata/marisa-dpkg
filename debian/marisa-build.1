.SH NAME
marisa\-build \- A tool to build a dictionary from a set of key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B marisa\-build
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmarisa\-build\fP is a tool to build a dictionary from a set of keys. This
tool takes as input newline\-delimited keys and writes the dictionary to the
standard output.
.PP
Users can specify parameters through command line options. See
\fBmarisa\-build \-h\fP for the list of options.
.PP
If an input line contains horizontal tabs, the last one serves as the delimiter
between a key and its weight which is used to optimize the order of nodes.
Estimated frequency of each key, given as the weight, may improve the search
performance.
.SH SEE ALSO
The programs are generated from /usr/share/doc/libmarisa\-dev/readme.en.html
in \fBlibmarisa\-dev\fP package.
